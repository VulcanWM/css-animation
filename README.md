# CSS Animation Template
This is a template to make CSS Animations with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

To define a frame in HTML, make sure to create a `<div>` with the id: `frame[number]`. If the frame isn't the first one, add the inline-styling `style="display: none;"` to the div. Also this template contains a `class` called "frame", which decides how big the frame will be and it's border, so add the class "frame" to the frame div as well.

While using the template, you can change these JavaScript variables:

- `seconds`: This is the number of seconds each frame is showed for. *Default: 0.5*
- `loop`: This defines if the animation plays on a loop or not. *Default: true*
- `play`: This defines if the animation starts automatically playing. *Default: true*
- `numberOfFrames`: This the number of frames in your animation
